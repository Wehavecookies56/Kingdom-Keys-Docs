# Danger Blox

Danger Blox are Bug Blox that act similarly to [Cacti](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Cactus) however they can be placed like normal blocks and hurt the player when punching the block as well as walking into it.
They can only be obtained in the [Bug Blox veins that generate on the surface of the overworld](../worldgen/bugblox)
